## ide-backend-common

Common shared library for ide-backend ide-backend-server

It can be compiled using [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs).
This comes in handy because it's also used by
[stack-ide's API](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-ide/tree/master/stack-ide-api).
This allows us to easily talk to stack-ide from GHCJS!
