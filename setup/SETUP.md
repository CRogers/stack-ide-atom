IDE backend requirements for ghc/package environments
=====================================================

Now that the IDE backend supports multiple versions of ghc, there is a greater
complexity in the requirements on the various ghc and package environments
needed to build it and run it.

We will try to document here what those requirements are, both abstractly and
a specific recipe using (one flavour of) sandboxes.


General points
--------------

Firstly, let us look at the IDE backend components:

 * ide-backend: a library, linked into the isolation-runner
 * ide-backend-server: an exe, invoked by the ide-backend library
 * ide-backend-rts: a library, loaded at runtime by the ide-backend-server

The other important components here are ghc itself (various versions, some
patches), and the many library packages available to the end users (stackage
etc).

The IDE backend architecture supports multiple versions of ghc by having
multiple instances of the ide-backend-server, one instance built against each
supported ghc. The ide-backend library can then talk to one of these
executables.

So **note**: the ide-backend library does not have to be built with the same
version of ghc as the ide-backend-server; indeed when supporting multiple ghc
versions that would be impossible.

The ide-backend-server *must* be built with the same ghc and set of libraries
as it will use at runtime. This is because (like ghci) it has to load these
libraries at runtime. (Technically, it may be possible to use a set of
libraries at runtime built by a different instance of the same version of ghc,
however this is playing with fire.)

The ide-backend-server must be built with a patched version of ghc (that
provides some extra hooks the IDE needs).

Thus we have the requirement that all the user packages also be built with this
patched ghc. (Again, it may be possible to use a different instance of the same
version of ghc, but we cannot guarantee ABI compatibility in such a setup.)


Environments
------------

So we can identify three separate environments:

 * build environment for ide-backend + isolation-runner
 * user environment with ghc 7.4.x
 * user environment with ghc 7.8.x

The build environment for ide-backend + isolation-runner could be the same as
one of the user environments, but it does not have to be. For example it could
use a stock ghc-7.6.


Build environment for ide-backend
---------------------------------

This environment is relatively straightforward. It can use a stock (ie
unpatched) ghc. The ide-backend does not depend on the GHC library and because
of that it has (in principle) relatively flexible dependencies. We have of
course been testing ide-backend with ghc-7.4, but in principle it could work
with any other version, possibly with a little fairly ordinary porting. For
example, if it made technical sense for the isolation-runner to use ghc-7.6,
then that would be no problem for ide-backend.


User environment with ghc 7.4.x
-------------------------------

The instance of the ide-backend-server used at runtime for the ghc 7.4.x user
environment must of course be compatible with this environment, because it will
at runtime load packages from it. The only way to guarantee this is to build it
in this environment.

Building ide-backend-server does require the patched ghc instance. So this
implies the full environment must be built with this patched ghc instance, not
a stock ghc 7.4.

An instance of ide-backend-rts must be available in this environment so that
the ide-backend-server instance can use it.

However, the build-time dependencies of ide-backend-server do not need be
present in the environment at runtime. In practice this means that while it
must be built with the same ghc and global package db, its extra build time
dependencies can live in a separate package db that is not made available at
runtime.


User environment with ghc 7.8.x
-------------------------------

Similar points as above apply.
Ghc 7.8 snapshot still needs some patches. The same point as above applies
about building the user packages with this ghc instance.


$PATH setup
-----------

At runtime, when using the ide-backend library, the library has to be able to
find both ghc and the compatible instance of ide-backend-server.

The ide-backend library can be instructed to search extra dirs in addition to
the process $PATH. To support multiple different ghc versions this mechanism
must be used. Set up the $PATH so that ghc and ide-backend-server are *not*
present, and then pass the extra search dirs when initialising and IdeSession.
This will allow multiple IdeSessions in a single isolation-runner process to
use different ghc versions.


More details and worked example using sandboxes
===============================================

In order to make sure that ide-backend works even when completely isolated from
ide-backend-server (after all, we want different ide-backend-servers for
different versions of ghc, each with their own package DBs), these instructions
assume the sandbox approach described in
http://www.edsko.net/2013/02/10/comprehensive-haskell-sandboxes/ ; we summarize
the approach below.  It is of course not required to follow that approach; if
using a different approach, these instructions can still help settings things
up, mutatis mutandis.

We have various "sandboxes" (build environments) represented by directories

    ~/env/fpco-stock-7.4
    ~/env/fpco-patched-7.4
    ~/env/fpco-patched-7.8

a symlink

    ~/env/active -> ~/env/fpco-stock-7.4

(or whichever sandbox is "active"). Then we have (non-changing) symlinks

    ~/.ghc   -> ~/env/active/dot-ghc
    ~/.cabal -> ~/env/active/dot-cabal
    ~/local  -> ~/env/active/local

The fpco-stock-7.4 sandbox
--------------------------

This is the sandbox in which we compile the ide-backend client, and the
infrastructure surrounding it. The version of ghc here is not so important;
this could be ghc 7.6 for instance (i.e., it is unrelated to the version that
we use for ide-backend-server). For now we will assume it's a stock 7.4.

* If you want to profile, you may want to set

      library-profiling: True

  in your ~/.cabal/config.

* Install:

  - Standard installation of ghc 7.4.2
  - ide-backend/vendor/cabal/Cabal (Cabal-ide-backend) and
    ide-backend/vendor/binary (binary-ide-backend)
  - ide-backend and dependencies

NOTE on installing Cabal-ide-backend: Cabal-ide-backend relies on
binary-ide-backend; this is just for compatibility with the rest ide-backend,
and it can build against the standard binary, but it does need binary >= 0.7 in
order to build. If you are building Cabal in an environment with, say,
binary-0.5 and binary-ide-backend-0.7.3.0, then calling configure on Cabal will
fail because configuring cabal builds all of cabal (this is a quick of cabal --
bootstrapping problem). To fix this, temporarily hide binary and expose
binary-ide-backend when building Cabal.

The fpco-patched-7.4 and fpco-patched-7.8 sandboxes
---------------------------------------------------

The setup instructions for these two sandboxes are almost the same; there are
only a few minor differences, explained when they come up.

* Set

      documentation: True

  in ~/.cabal/config so that .haddock files are created (these are necessary to
  so that ide-backend-server can create more informative identifier
  information).

  (There is probably not much point in installing profiling libraries in this
  sandbox because the ghc api is not useable in profiling mode.)

* Since we will want to reference tools (such as haddock) and files (such as
  package registration files to locate the library binaries) from this sandbox
  while another sandbox is active, we have to make sure that the "prefix"
  picked by Cabal should not include symlinks which may point to one location
  at installation time and another at runtime. It is therefore a good idea to
  set

      install-dirs user
        prefix: /Users/dev/env/fpco-patched-7.4/dot-cabal

  in your ~/.cabal/config (or whatever the absolute path is).

  (See http://www.edsko.net/2013/02/10/comprehensive-haskell-sandboxes/ , the
  last section, "Known Limitations".)

* Install

  - The appropriate branch of ghc (see below)
  - ide-backend/vendor/binary (binary-ide-backend)
  - ide-backend-server and dependencies (including alex/happy)

* Create package DB for snippets (the "snippet DB")

  The snippet DB is logically independent of the DB used to build
  ide-backend-server: the dependencies of ide-backend-server do not have to be
  available when ide-backend-server runs. (Moreover, it is conceivable that
  ide-backend-server relies on version X of a particular package, but we want
  to make version Y available in the snippet DB.)

  However, the packages in the snippet DB should be compiled with the patched
  ghc (ghci can only load guarantee to libs built by the same ghc instance -- a
  different instance of the same ghc version may work but you're playing with
  fire).

  To initialize the snippet DB use

      ghc-pkg init /Users/dev/env/fpco-patched-7.8/dot-ghc/snippet-db

  To install packages into the snippet DB use

      cabal install --package-db=clear \
                    --package-db=global \
                    --package-db=/Users/dev/env/fpco-patched-7.8/dot-ghc/snippet-db

  (modifying absolute paths as required, of course).  Clearing the package DB
  is necessary so that we do not rely on any dependencies in the user DB (which
  will not be available when ide-backend-server runs).

  You will want to install

  - ide-backend/rts (required)
  - the test suite requires the following packages (you might of course want to
    use a separate snippet DB for the test suite:)

    * parallel (tested with 3.2.0.4, 3.2.0.6; necessary also for 7.8 now)
    * mtl (tested with 2.1.3.1, 2.2.1)
    * monads-tf (testd with 0.1.0.1, 0.1.0.2)
    * yesod-1.2.4 (optional; only required for one test; install with
      cabal --max-backjumps=-1; do not attempt for 7.8 for now))
    * parsec-3.1.3 (optional; only required for one test)

    The tests are no longer as picky as they used to be about the versions of
    these packages; if you are getting test failures with different versions,
    you should file a bug.

    However, the *order* in which you install the above is important: you must
    install mtl before monads-tf or you will get test failures (this is due
    to incompletely package information in the ghc runtime (#95).
  - whatever other packages you want to be available to snippets at runtime

Running the tests
=================

The tests (as well as the ide-backend client library itself) will be compiled
in the fpco-stock-7.4 sandbox, and can be run inside that sandbox (or indeed in
an empty sandbox where no ghc compiler is available on the path at all), as
long as we specify the right paths.

The most conversative way to run the test suite is:

    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin \
    dist/build/TestSuite/TestSuite \
      --extra-paths-74  ~/env/fpco-patched-7.4/local/bin:~/env/fpco-patched-7.4/dot-cabal/bin:~/env/fpco-stock-7.4/dot-cabal/bin   \
      --extra-paths-78  ~/env/fpco-patched-7.8/local/bin:~/env/fpco-patched-7.8/dot-cabal/bin:~/env/fpco-stock-7.4/dot-cabal/bin   \
      --extra-paths-710 ~/env/fpco-patched-7.10/local/bin:~/env/fpco-patched-7.10/dot-cabal/bin:~/env/fpco-stock-7.4/dot-cabal/bin \
      --package-db-74  ~/env/fpco-patched-7.4/dot-ghc/snippet-db  \
      --package-db-78  ~/env/fpco-patched-7.8/dot-ghc/snippet-db  \
      --package-db-710 ~/env/fpco-patched-7.10/dot-ghc/snippet-db \
      --test-74  \
      --test-78  \
      --test-710 \
      --no-session-reuse \
      -j1

The test suite runs the tests against both 7.4 and 7.8, and configures the
sessions correspondingly given the above command line options. In this example
we make sure that the stock 7.4 DB is always in the path because that's where
we assume we can find ide-backend-exe-cabal. The --test-74 and --test-78 are
used to specify against which GHC version we want to run the tests; you can
omit either (or both, in which case no tests will run at all).

The --no-session-reuse option runs every test in a fresh session; this isolated
the effects of that particular test and should be used on test failure, but
slows the tests down so can be omitted. The -j1 option runs one test at a time,
for similar reasons.

Installing the patched versions of ghc
======================================

In order to build ghc, you need ghc; both ghc 7.4 and ghc 7.8 can be built
using the stock 7.4; if using the sandboxes approach, you will want a sandbox
active that contains a stock 7.4 compiler (fpco-stock-7.4 will do).

ghc 7.4
-------

* Get ghc from fpco; in ~/env/fpco-patched-7.4/local/src, run

      git clone git@github.com:fpco/ghc

* Go to the ghc directory, and checkout the ide-backend branch of 7.4.2:

      git checkout ide-backend-experimental-74

* Get the 7.4.2 release of the core libraries:

      ./sync-all --no-dph -r git://git.haskell.org get
      ./sync-all checkout -b ghc-7.4.2 ghc-7.4.2-release

* Make sure we're still in the experimental branch of ghc:

      git checkout ide-backend-experimental-74

* Create build.mk

      cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk

  select the quick BuildFlavour

      BuildFlavour = quick

  and make sure haddocks get built by setting

      HADDOCK_DOCS = YES

  in the section for the "quick" build flavour (make sure there are no trailing
  spaces in your build.mk).

  NOTE: This assumes wanting to do ghc dev. For performance builds you should
  pick a different build flavour.

* Build as usual

      perl boot && ./configure && make -j8

  (Note on OSX Mavericks: use gcc-4.8 (or maybe gcc-4.2) instead, and disable
  DTRACE:

      export CC=`which gcc-4.8`
      perl boot && ./configure && make -j8 USE_DTRACE=NO

  If you don't want to disable DTRACE, it might work to cherry-pick
  https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/8878541d02ad15fbdbd04608cbc6ea3fde5d5beb;
  YMMV. See also https://gist.github.com/cartazio/7131371).

* Make the in-place compiler available as normal; i.e. create the following
  symlinks in ~/env/fpco-patched-7.4/local/bin:

      ghc                 -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2
      ghc-7.4.2.20140313  -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2
      ghc-pkg             -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-pkg
      haddock             -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/haddock
      hsc2hs              -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/hsc2hs

ghc 7.8
-------

The instructions for 7.8 are much as they are for 7.4,
though it may be more troublesome to get the right versions of libraries
(TODO: ideally, we'd be using a specific snapshot, but this is made
a bit awkward by the fact that ghc does not make proper use of git subrepos).

* Get ghc from fpco; in ~/env/fpco-patched-7.8/local/src, run

      git clone git@github.com:fpco/ghc

* Go to the ghc directory, and checkout the ide-backend branch of 7.8:

      git checkout ide-backend-7.8.4

* Get the corresponding version of the core libraries:

      ./sync-all --no-dph -r git://git.haskell.org get -b ghc-7.8

  WARNING: There are no ghc-7.8.4-release tags for these libraries, so this
  checks out the "latest" 7.8 branch for each dependency. This may or may not
  break in the future. Just for reference, I have included the fingerprint of
  the repo as I built it as ghc-7.8.4.fp in this directory.

* Create build.mk

      cp mk/build.mk.sample mk/build.mk

  select the quick BuildFlavour

      BuildFlavour = quick

  and make sure haddocks get built by setting

      HADDOCK_DOCS = YES

  in the section for the "quick" build flavour (make sure there are no trailing
  spaces in your build.mk).

  NOTE: This assumes wanting to do ghc dev. For performance builds you should
  pick a different build flavour.

* Build as usual

      perl boot && ./configure && make -j8

  (OSX Mavericks: Unlike 7.4, ghc 7.8 can build with clang so you don't need to
  do anything special.)

* Make the in-place compiler available as normal; i.e. create the following
  symlinks in ~/env/fpco-patched-7.8/local/bin:

      ghc              -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2
      ghc-7.8.4.<date> -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2
      ghc-pkg          -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-pkg
      haddock          -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/haddock
      hsc2hs           -> ../src/ghc/inplace/bin/hsc2hs

  (<date> will vary).

* You will probably also want to install the bundled Haddock (in the new
  sandbox): run

      cabal install

  in utils/haddock.

ghc 7.10
--------

There are no changes to ghc necessary. Just run `cabal install` from
the `ide-backend` directory or `cabal install ide-backend` to install
from hackage.

Using cabal sandboxes
=====================

We need to build one instance of ide-backend-server per ghc version we want to
support; for ghc 7.4.2 we need a patched ghc to do this; for ghc 7.8 and 7.10
patches are optional. In this section we describe how to build
ide-backend-server against all versions of ghc. When we say a particular version
of ghc is "active" we simply mean that it's in the path; we will build
everything in their own sandbox. See [Comprehensive Haskell Sandboxes,
Revisted](http://www.edsko.net/2015/03/09/sandboxes-revisited/) for some details
on using sandboxes with multiple versions of ghc.

Sandbox for building the server
-------------------------------

### For ghc 7.4.2 and 7.8.4

With the patched compiler active, create the new sandbox in
`~/path/to/ide-backend/server`:

```
cabal sandbox init --sandbox ./.cabal-sandbox/7.8.4
cabal sandbox add-source ../vendor/binary
cabal install
```

Or, if you want to hack on `ide-backend-server`, replace that last line with

```
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install --only
```

TODO: Would be nicer if we could remove the need for ide-backend-binary, but
this would mean dropping support for ghc 7.4.2.

### For ghc 7.10

This works pretty much as it does for `ghc` 7.8.4, but we need to install the
Haddock bundled with `ghc`:

```
cabal sandbox init --sandbox ./.cabal-sandbox/7.10
cabal sandbox add-source ../vendor/binary
cabal sandbox add-source ~/path/to/ghc/7.10/utils/haddock/haddock-{library,api}
cabal install
```

Or, if you want to hack on `ide-backend-server`, replace that last line with

```
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install --only
```

(Currently this relies on a patched version of `bytestring-trie`; hopefully this
will be resolved before the official release.)

Sandbox for building the library
--------------------------------

With either a patched or a stock ghc, run in `~/path/to/ide-backend`:

```
cabal sandbox init
cabal sandbox add-source vendor/binary
cabal sandbox add-source vendor/cabal/Cabal
cabal install
```

Or, if you want to hack on `ide-backend-server`, replace that last line with

```
cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
cabal configure --enable-tests
cabal build
cabal install --only
```

Setting up snippet sandboxes for running the tests
--------------------------------------------------

There are lots of ways you could do this; I find this way convenient. Create
a directory `snippet-dbs`, and then for each patched version of `ghc` run,

```
cabal sandbox init --sandbox=./.cabal-sandbox/<ghc version>
echo "documentation: True" >cabal.config
cabal install parallel
cabal install mtl
cabal install monads-tf
cabal install ~/path/to/ide-backend/rts
```

and optionally also install `yesod` and `parsec` (this is only necessary for a
few tests). It is important to install `parallel`, `mtl` and `monads-tf` in this
order (issue #95). It is also important to use the patched version of `ghc`
here, not because we need those patches but because the version used to compile
these snippets must match the version used by the `ide-backend-server`.

Running the tests
-----------------

The safest way to run the test suite is to do:

```
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:~/path/to/ide-backend/.cabal-sandbox/bin:~/path/to/cabal \
dist/build/TestSuite/TestSuite: \
  --extra-paths-74  ~/path/to/patched/ghc/7.4.2:~/path/to/7.4.2/ide-backend-server \
  --extra-paths-78  ~/path/to/patched/ghc/7.8.4:~/path/to/7.8.4/ide-backend-server \
  --extra-paths-710 ~/path/to/patched/ghc/7.10:~/path/to/7.10/ide-backend-server \
  --package-db-74  ~/path/to/snippet-dbs/.cabal-sandbox/7.4.2/x86_64-osx-ghc-*-packages.conf.d \
  --package-db-78  ~/path/to/snippet-dbs/.cabal-sandbox/7.8.4/x86_64-osx-ghc-*-packages.conf.d \
  --package-db-710 ~/path/to/snippet-dbs/.cabal-sandbox/7.10/x86_64-osx-ghc-*-packages.conf.d \
  --test-74  \
  --test-78  \
  --test-710 \
  --no-session-reuse \
  -j1
```

If you want to speed up the tests you can leave out `--no-session-reuse` and
`-j1`; this _should_ work equally well but may not. If it doesn't, this may
either indicate a bug in the test suite or in `ide-backend` itself.

DEBUGGING
=========

* If ide-backend complains about being unable to open dynamic libraries (even
  with ghc 7.4, or with ghc 7.8 NOT configured for dynamic libraries), such as
  when running the test-suite:

        Capture stdout (single putStrLn): [Failed]
        Unexpected errors: SourceError {errorKind = KindError, errorSpan = <from GhcException>, errorMsg = "<command line>: can't load .so/.DLL for: libHSide-backend-rts-0.1.3.dylib (dlopen(libHSide-backend-rts-0.1.3.dylib, 9): image not found)"}

  it is possible that cross-sandbox references are not absolute; for example, check the output of

        ghc-pkg --package-conf=/Users/dev/env/fpco-patched-7.4/dot-ghc/snippet-db describe ide-backend-rts

  all paths there should be absolute. See section about "install-dirs user" above.

  Note that this error is not about dynamic libraries _per se_, which is why
  this is so confusing. ghc looks for the RTS (ide-backend-rts) and it looks
  for it in a number of places; the .dylib is simply the last place (or perhaps
  the first, not 100% sure) and that just happens to be the error message that
  is generated, even if it also checked elsewhere (in particular, even if it
  also tried to load static libraries).
